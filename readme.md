# What is an [Amazon Manufacturers Representative](https://www.andersonassociates.net/) Agency?

[Anderson & Associates](https://www.andersonassociates.net/) is a special breed of Manufacturers Representative agency that focuses on Amazon specifically.

Manufacturers Representatives are consultants that sit between brands and retailers, with a chair at the table to help translate and manage the relationship.

For example, if you invented a widget and patented it and got it manufactured for resale, there is a huge amount of work that is required *before any products ever touch a retail building*.

- R & D -- how much engineering work was done to invent the widget?
- Patenting -- How much legal work was done to protect your invention?
- Manufacturing - how much product design interation happened to get things built?


As the internet becomes closer to every human in existence, eCommerce is naturally becoming closer to every human and Amazon currently has a monopoly on eCommerce retail.

Anderson & Associates exists because most retail growth is happening on eCommerce. If you run a paint company, then your products and packaging should be altered to fit the eCommerce model.
