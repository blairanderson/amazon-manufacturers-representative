# What Are Manufacturers Reps?

I have been in this industry for a while, but describing the job to other people is always funny because its a fairly small niche. I wanted to attempt to answer some basic questions about the industry and hone my thinking.

## What do Manufacturers Reps Do?

Manufacturers Representatives are consultants (a 3rd party company) that sit between brands and retailers. Brands often value reps at the table to help translate and manage the relationship. They are compensated with a commission structure on sales that are generated from the customer during the contract. There are millions(probably) of retailers in the world, and its not easy to get your product onto the shelves of all those retailers stores. Its much easier to work with 50 reps across the country, and pay for your performance.


Typically reps will "cover a territory", so you might be the potato chip guy in Montana, and it would be a lot of work to travel to texas to sell more chips. It would be easier for you to also take on a cracker company in your territory, because its easier to sell to your current customers than new customers.

For example, if you invented a widget and patented it and got it manufactured for resale, there is a huge amount of work that is required *before any products ever touch a retail building*.

- R & D -- how much engineering work was done to invent the widget?
- Patenting -- How much legal work was done to protect your invention?
- Manufacturing - how much product design interation happened to get things built?


In the future(right now) we have a new breed of [Amazon Manufacturers Reps](https://www.andersonassociates.net/) which help companies translate their physical packaging to online customers. I don't mean language translation, i mean that brands typically spend huge amounts of money to design their physical packaging, so that consumers can easily feel like it will solve their problems. We have even less time online to pass products through that barrier.


## What is an Amazon Manufacturers Representative Agency?

As the internet becomes closer to every human in existence, eCommerce is naturally becoming closer to every human and Amazon currently has a monopoly on eCommerce retail.

Anderson & Associates exists because most retail growth is happening on eCommerce. If you run a paint company, then your products and packaging should be altered to fit the eCommerce model.
